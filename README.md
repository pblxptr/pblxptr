- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @pblxptr, currently working as Embedded Software Developer, developing software/firmware that mostly run on ARM devices.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in low-level aspects of programming, digital electronic, microprocessors, microcontrollers, operating systems (Linux Kernel, Zephyr), hardware and home automation. My favorite programming languages are C, C++, Python. Hopefully someday Rust will join to this list.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Rust programming language and Home Automation integrations through Home Assistant. Also I try to keep up with C++ language development.
